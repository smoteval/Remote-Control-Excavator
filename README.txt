This was a direct manipulation UI course project.
I used affine transformation for the interactive aspects of this project.

How to run:
-"make" will compile and run the program.

For more infromation, here is a link to the description of the project:

Some more details:

Scailing: For scailing, when the mouse pointer is on the object you want to scale, the mouse needs to be draged (to right or left)
while right-click is held.


Enhancement: The bucket is in fact a strong magnet that can move the grey block. If you move the bucket to the grey block and click on the block, the magnet will be turned on and attach the block to itself. If you want to drop the block, you just need to click on it agin but it will just be dettched from the tractor (due to time constraint I did not implement gravity).  


Recording: When you start or stop recording/scripting, the excavator get back to it's initial position
